# Customer-Segmentation using Deep Learning

Customer segmentation is a crucial process for businesses to divide customers into groups based on their common characteristics such as age, gender, profession, and interests. This segmentation enables companies to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences, allowing them to design targeted marketing strategies for each segment.

## Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model using TensorFlow that can accurately predict the segment (A, B, C, or D) of new potential customers for an automobile company planning to enter new markets. The model will be trained on existing customer data, where customers have already been classified into four segments (A, B, C, or D) based on various attributes.

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle:[ Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abisheksudarshan/customer-segmentation).
